This should start the application on embedded Tomcat server @ localhost, port: 8080, with sample console messages like below

Application output can be seen in browser by hitting the URL with category Id and label type(optional)

    Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/v1/categories/{categoryId}/discounted-products?labelType={labelType}
   
    Example: 
    
      - http://localhost:8080/v1/categories/600001506/discounted-products
      - http://localhost:8080/v1/categories/600001506/discounted-products?labelType=ShowWasNow
      - http://localhost:8080/v1/categories/600001506/discounted-products?labelType=ShowWasThenNow
      - http://localhost:8080/v1/categories/600001506/discounted-products?labelType=ShowPercDscount
 
Formatted JSON response of discounted products under that category or Respective Error messages should get displayed on the browser. Price label formatting is according to the allowed labelType passed as URL parameter (default is - Show Was, Now).
